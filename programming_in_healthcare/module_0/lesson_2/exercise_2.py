print("Let's create and print some variables!")

# We have done the first one for you
drug_given = True
print("The drug was given to the patient: ", drug_given)

# Create a variable that stores the patient's age (hint use an integer)
# Print the patient's age

# Create a variable that stores the patient's weight over several days
# Weights are: 70, 71, 72, 73, 74
# Hint: use a list
# Print the patient's weights

# Create a variable that stores the patient's name
# Print the patient's name

# Create a variable that stores the patient's haemoglobin level
# Hint: use a float
# Print the patient's haemoglobin level

# Create a variable that stores several observations of a patient
# Observations are - temperature = 37.2oC, pulse = 80 bpm, blood pressure = 120/80
# Hint: use a dictionary
# Print the patient's observations

# If that all worked, please move on to exercise 3
