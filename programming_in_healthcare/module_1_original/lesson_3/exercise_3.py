"""Lesson 3 - exercise 3

Let's build a clinical web app. Some useful links:

https://pathlabs.rlbuht.nhs.uk/eGFRcalculator.htm
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kidney-disease/diagnosis/

Gotten stuck, look at the slides at:

Warning:
This is not to be used as a real life medical app! This is for training purposes only.

# If that worked, please move on to exercise 4
# You also need to stop streamlit using CTRL / CMD - C
# Remember to change the file name in the command line as well, eg
