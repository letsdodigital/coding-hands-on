import streamlit as st


# Write a function named 'calculate_egfr'.
# Define a variable in this function called `egfr` and set it to '45'.
# Have this function return egfr.


def main():
    st.title("eGFR calculator")
    # Call the 'calculate_egfr' function above and store the value as return_egfr
    # write the returned value to the browser
    return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Run the above code and see if you have the number 45 in the browser window

# If that worked, please move on to exercise 3
# You also need to stop streamlit using CTRL / CMD - C
# Remember to change the file name in the command line as well, eg
# $ streamlit run exercise_3.py
