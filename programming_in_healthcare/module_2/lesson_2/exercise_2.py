"""Exercise 2 - Application Process Interface (API) testing

Run the app using the command:
    $ streamlit run exercise_2.py

OUTLINE: here we are going to get you to use an API. What is an API? Think of 
this as a means for you to communicate with another computer program running on 
your own computer or even elsewhere over the internet. 

NOTES: Look back at the lecture notes for how to connect to the database for this 
project via its API and also other code you need for displaying things in the web
browser.

See https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-2/ to help you if you
get stuck.
