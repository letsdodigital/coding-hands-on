"""Exercise 9 - Time for a proper form and saving of state

OUTLINE: We are going to get you to create some functions. Next we will get you
to create a form that can be submitted and then start the outline of 
functionality needed around these forms. We will also get you to remove some code
that is no longer needed.

NOTES: Look up how to create functions in the lecture notes if you are not
comfortable with them yet. You might need to look up forms as well.

See https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-2/ to help you if you
get stuck.

# Create a function called `initialise`, that takes no arguments and returns
# nothing

# Create a function called `on_change_hospital_number`, which takes no arguments
# and writes to the browser the value of the field created later in this
# exercise below with the key `hospital_number_input`. Hint, you need to
# use `st.session_state`.

# Create a function called `on_change_intervention`, which takes no arguments
# and writes to the browser the value of field created later in this exercise
# below with the key `intervention_input`.
