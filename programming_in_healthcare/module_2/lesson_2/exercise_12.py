"""Exercise 12 - Updating functions and managing the submit button

OUTLINE: We are now going to get you to bulk out the functions you have already
written and then write a new one. We are also going to get you to check that 
all fo the fields within the form (there will be a black thin border around 
these fields) are all filled with data.

See https://letsdodigital.org/learn/learn-python/module-2/ to help you if you
get stuck.
