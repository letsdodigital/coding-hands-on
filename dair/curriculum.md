# Curriculum

## Learning Outcomes

### High level Learning outcomes
At the end of this course, the attendee would be able to 
1. understand the basis of a structured tabular data and unstructured data such as image data 
2. fit a basic model such as linear/ logistic regression using the tabular data 
3. fit a basic deep learning model to image data [?Is it DAIR objective]
4. understand model diagnostics and challenges
5. appreciate qualitiative understanding behind the model fitting approaches 

### Core skills
1. coding skills: translation of an 'idea' to a code [the practical]
2. modelling skills: understanding of how a model works [the theory]
3. project management skills: understanding of code and modelling skills to structure the project and collect/communicate results 

### Low level learning outcomes

1. Pre exploratory data analysis [numpy, pandas] link with core skill [1,3]
- appreciate how pandas is built on numpy
- numpy data structures and why
- how does computers think/ matrices, arrays,
- matrices, tensors, vectors, 
- convert matrices to dataframes
- one-hot encoding and why 
- understand pandas index based system
- subsetting rows, columns
- performing basic merging of data
- performing basic grouping analysis
- performing basic aggregation
- date times in pandas

2. Basic plotting [matplotlib, seaborn] core skill [1,3]
- basic plotting with matplotlib
- understanding different APIs to plotting
- understanding an alternative to matplotlib with seaborn as an high level api
- plotnine and grammar of graphics as a flavour 
- undertake basic scatter plot, histograms, stratification by plot
- if timeallows, pie chart
- if timeallows, exporting plot

3. EDA [sklearn, matplotlib, pandas] core skill [2,3,1]
- Understand what EDA is 
- Why do EDA and where does EDA fit in your data analysis pipeline
- missing data, collinearity and variance management
- Undertake EDA 
- Learn to write custom functions and why
- Learn to debug and deal with 'error messages'. 
- learng to use documentation to debug 


DAIR 

4. Post DAIR / Now you have a model, so what
- how do you assess a fitted model
- types of model
- philosophy of model fitting 
- insights from model
- model diagnostics and their flaws

5. MODELLING [I am thinking we shouldnt do it at this stage as should be more DAIR]
- parametric model vs. non-parametric models; why
- linear / logistic regression as a parametric model example
- assumptions of models
- train and test sets, 
- bias variance trade off and overfitting
- k-nearest neighbour model as a flexible non-parametric model
- What is a hyperparameter?
- how does hyper-parameter effect model output?
- hyperparameter tuning?

6. MODEL Evaluation
- You built a model so what?
- evaluating regression models
- evaluating classification models
- common diagnostics
- how to deal with overfitting.
- how to deal with multicollinearity 
- how to deal with missing data and sensitivity analysis
