# JS CODESPACE

This is a repository of the javascript code for the LDD course. 

## Installation 
1. Open github codespaces 
2. Git clone repository   
`git clone xxxx`

## Preview HTML
I recommend installing the `preview` extension so you can easily look at what the html code is doing.

Alternatively, start a live-server with python using
`python -m http.server 8000`


## Sections 
- Each folder is representative of the module name and submodule
ie. 5-3-start-sandbox correlates to module5, section 3. 

work through the code step by step and in sequence.

## Additional content
`tests` folder is a setup for writing unittests with javascript
get this running by 

1. Install jest    
`npm install --save-dev jest`
2. Running in terminal
`npm test`
